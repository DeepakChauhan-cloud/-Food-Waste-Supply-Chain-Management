# -Food-Waste-Supply-Chain-Management
This repository contains the final year project report and related materials for the Food and Waste Supply Chain Management System, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering at JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida, under Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University.

📘 Project Overview
The aim of this study is to identify and analyze the critical factors that inhibit the reduction of food waste in the Indian Agri-Food Supply Chain (AFSC). By minimizing food waste, the system promotes sustainability from economic, social, and environmental perspectives.

A total of 33 inhibiting factors were identified through literature review and expert consultations. These were grouped into 9 broad categories using Delphi analysis, and their interrelationships were studied using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and MICMAC analysis.

🎯 Objectives
Identify key barriers to food waste reduction in the Agri-Food Supply Chain.

Group related inhibiting factors into super-sets for simplification.

Analyze interdependencies among these groups using ISM.

Classify the driving and dependence power of each factor using MICMAC analysis.

Provide managerial insights to stakeholders for a sustainable and efficient AFSC.

🧩 Methodology
Literature Review: To extract a comprehensive list of food waste-related factors.

Delphi Method: Expert consultation to validate and refine the list.

Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM): To determine hierarchical relationships between grouped factors.

MICMAC Analysis: Classification of factors into:

Independent (high driving, low dependence),

Linkage (high driving, high dependence),

Dependent (low driving, high dependence),

Autonomous (low driving, low dependence).

🔍 Key Findings
33 critical factors were initially identified and grouped into 9 super factors, including:

Supply Chain Uncertainty

Technical Support

Consumerism

Policy and Framework

Inefficient Infrastructure

Distribution Network, etc.

Information Technology was found to be a linkage factor, playing a critical enabling role in food waste reduction.

Independent factors like supply chain uncertainty and food characteristics require the most attention.

📊 Tools & Techniques Used
