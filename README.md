# Food and Waste Supply Chain Management System

This repository contains the final year project report and materials for **Food and Waste Supply Chain Management System**, developed as part of the Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering at **JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida**, under **Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University**.  

---

## 📘 Project Overview  
The study identifies and analyzes critical factors inhibiting food waste reduction in the **Indian Agri-Food Supply Chain (AFSC)**. By addressing these barriers, the system promotes sustainability across economic, social, and environmental dimensions.  
- **33 inhibiting factors** were identified through literature review and expert consultations.  
- Grouped into **9 categories** using Delphi analysis.  
- Interrelationships studied via **Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM)** and **MICMAC analysis**.  

**Alignment**: Supports UN Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 (halving food waste by 2030).

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Identify barriers to food waste reduction in the AFSC.  
2. Group inhibiting factors into super-sets for simplification.  
3. Analyze interdependencies among factors using ISM.  
4. Classify factors by driving/dependence power via MICMAC analysis.  
5. Provide actionable insights for stakeholders to improve AFSC efficiency.

## 🧩 Methodology  
### 1. Literature Review  
Extracted 33 critical factors contributing to food waste in the AFSC.  

### 2. Delphi Method  
Validated and refined factors through expert consultations.  

### 3. Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM)  
Mapped hierarchical relationships between 9 grouped categories.  

### 4. MICMAC Analysis  
Classified factors into four clusters:  
- **Independent** (high driving, low dependence)  
- **Linkage** (high driving, high dependence)  
- **Dependent** (low driving, high dependence)  
- **Autonomous** (low driving, low dependence)

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **9 Super Factors** identified:  
  - Supply Chain Uncertainty  
  - Technical Support  
  - Consumerism  
  - Policy and Framework  
  - Inefficient Infrastructure  
  - Distribution Network  
  - *...and others*  
- **Information Technology** emerged as a *linkage factor* (critical enabler).  
- **Independent factors** (e.g., supply chain uncertainty) require prioritized intervention.
